# Time-Series-Unlabelled-Data

This project focuses on visualizing and analyzing unlabelled time series data from industrial machinery to understand and predict machine downtime events. The primary goal is to identify patterns or anomalies in the data—such as irregular sensor readings, operational inefficiencies, or recurring trends—that may precede downtime incidents. By leveraging data visualization techniques and exploratory analysis, the project aims to uncover actionable insights into the behaviors leading to downtime.
